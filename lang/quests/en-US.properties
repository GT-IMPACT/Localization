impact.43.name=Bricks for Coke Oven
impact.43.desc=This is just one type of brick. What do you think they are for?

impact.44.name=Simple Solar Boiler
impact.44.desc=It is a primitive boiler that produces steam using sunlight. When heated, the Solar Boiler has the same steam output as the Small Coal Boiler, at 150 liters of steam per 25 ticks total.\n\nPrinciple of operation:\nThe Solar Boiler uses the same heating and cooling math as the Small Coal Boiler, but its "fuel" is more complex.%n%nEvery 256 ticks the boiler checks if it can see the sun. If it can, it gives itself 8 units of fuel. For (approximately) 5 seconds (8x12 = 96 ticks) he is active out of that 8 units of fuel, his heat increases by 6 (+ 8-2). Over the next 8 seconds, it loses 3.25 heat (-1 per 45 ticks), resulting in a net change of ~2.75 heat per 13 seconds of daylight, or about 0.21 degrees per second. So it takes a cold solar boiler 6.3 minutes to start producing steam (20 to 100> temperature). Since a Minecraft day only lasts 10 minutes, if you are awake, the Solar Boiler will only produce Steam for about 5.5 minutes out of every 20-minute full day (3.7 minutes during the day, 1.8 minutes of cooling after dark). Thus, making solar boilers practical requires constant bed operation.\n\nSolar boilers require 38 minutes of continuous sunlight to reach maximum temperature (500). Unlike other boilers, the maximum temperature makes no difference to the solar boiler.\n\nThe boiler can hold 16,000 L of steam and 16,000 L of water. As long as its temperature is above 100, every 25 ticks it will consume 1 L of water and produce 150 L of steam.  Temperatures above 100 have no effect on steam production. The boiler will try to exhaust steam from all but the bottom side. However, it will take in water via piping from the bottom, which allows water piping to be safely placed under the boilers line. If the steam tank fills up, 1/4 of its capacity will be discarded, and a smoke particle and sound effect will be released as a warning.\n\nWater can be added to the boiler by right-clicking on the machine with water buckets, or by placing any kind of water cell in the water slot in the GUI. Like all GregTech machines, it will return an empty cell. If the temperature is above 100 and the boiler runs out of water, adding water will cause it to explode, so wait until it cools down.\n\nCalcification:\nSince the boiler remains active, it will slowly calcify, reducing the Steam output. Calcification takes effect after 10,000 cycles of Steam production (250,000 ticks, 208 minutes 20 seconds, just under 3.5 hours), after which the Steam output decreases by 1 L every 100 production cycles, to a minimum of 50 L per 25 ticks (1 / 3 normal output) after another 208 minutes and 20 seconds. This timer and its effects are reset if the boiler is raised and repositioned (it is not stored in the subject). The purpose of this change was to force manual interaction with low-tech single unit boilers, not just to ensure their continuous operation through automation.\n\nDo note that the time the boiler spends at temperatures below 100 (not producing steam) does not count toward calcification. In practice, this means that since (as noted above) the Solar Boiler runs for 5.5 minutes out of every 20-minute day, the Solar Boiler will server for about 12 hours before it begins to lose output for calcification if there is no sleep mode.

impact.45.name=First Tungstensteel

impact.47.desc=Tungstensteel Ingot is the main material of the IV tier.\nFor its crafting you need a high voltage, as well as Nichrome Coil Block.

impact.48.name=How to mine minerals
impact.48.desc=The world of IMPACT presents a completely unique system for generating fossil resources - there is no ore in the form of blocks. Ask why? And the answer is simple, automation is the key to progress! That's why the authors decided to give up ores in the world.\n\nDespite the lack of the ability to detect veins with the naked eye, this generation provides a more comfortable mining experience.\n\nThe advantages of giving up rock in the form of blocks:\n- Ore generation can be changed (developers) at any time. This will not break the existing worlds and update the modpack will be easy.\n- The GregTech ore is TileEntity - this is bad. What is a TileEntity is a block that has some functionality. The fewer such blocks in the world, the more stable the world is.\n- Rapid world generation when creating, uploading new chunks.\n\nThe principle of ore generation:\nOre is generated in 512x512 block regions, there are 64 different veins in a region, which are generated in 16 chunks (4x4).\nThere are 2 layers in the game:\n- layer #0: Small ore, can contain only 1 type of ore\n- layer #1: Normal ore, can contain up to 4 types of ore\n\nFor more information, see our website.

impact.53.name=Small Coal Boiler
impact.53.desc=You have moved on to the next stage of your development - Bronze Age.\n\nThis stage is to mine Steam, create steam engines and a lot of work with crafts. Steam is produced by boilers. The first boiler available is Small Coal Boiler.\n\nThe working principle:\nWater and fuel are supplied, steam comes out. Boiler has a minimum temperature of 20 and a maximum temperature of 500. Every 45 ticks, the boiler temperature decreases by 1. Every 12 ticks 1 energy is consumed from the current fuel and increases the temperature by 1. But when the boiler temperature is maxed, it will stop consuming fuel for further heating. This means that during the heating time the coal will only burn for 96 seconds, but when the boiler is at maximum temperature the coal will burn for 360 seconds, equal to 43200 liters of steam.\n\nThe boiler can have up to 16,000 liters of steam or 16,000 liters of water. As long as the boiler temperature is above 100, every 25 ticks the boiler will consume 1 liter of water and produce 150 liters of steam. Temperatures above 100 do not increase the rate of steam production. The boiler will try to remove steam through all sides of the block, except the bottom. The boiler receives water through the underside, allowing the water-transmitting pipes to be placed under the boiler line. If the steam storage is full, a quarter of its capacity will be released, and a smoke particle and a hissing sound will be created as a warning.\n\nWater can be added to the boiler by pressing the RMB on it with a bucket of water or by placing any water capsule in a special slot in the boiler. Just like any GregTech machine, it will give back an empty capsule. If the boiler heated above 100 runs out of water, then adding water will result in an explosion, so wait until it cools down.\n\nFuel (Energy):\n- Coal - 160 units.\n- Charcoal - 160 units.\n- Lignite - 120 units.\n- Coal Coke - 320 units.

impact.72.name=High Pressure Solar Boiler
impact.72.desc=When heated, the solar boiler has a steam output of 450 liters of steam per 25 ticks.\n\nPrinciple of operation:\nEvery 256 ticks, the boiler checks to see if it can see the sun. If it can, it gives itself 8 units of fuel. For (about) 5 seconds (8x12 = 96 ticks) he is active out of that 8 units of fuel, his heat increases by 6 (+ 8-2). During the next 8 seconds, it loses 5.4 heat (-1 per 75 ticks), resulting in a net change of ~4.6 heat per 13 seconds of daylight, or about 0.35 degrees per second. Therefore, a cold solar boiler takes 3.8 minutes to start producing steam (temperature from 20 to 100>).\n\nThe boiler can hold 32,000 L of steam and 16,000 L of water. As long as its temperature is above 100, every 25 ticks it will consume 3 L of water and produce 450 L of steam.  Temperatures above 100 have no effect on steam production.

impact.75.name=High Preshure Liquid Boiler
impact.75.desc=It consumes liquid fuel instead of solid fuel.\n\nPrinciple of operation:\nWater and fuel are supplied and steam comes out.\n\nLiquid can either be piped in or injected with buckets. When using pipes, the boiler can only hold 99 liters at a time, and takes it in 50 liters at a time.\n\nThe boiler has a minimum temperature of 20 and a maximum temperature of 1000. Every 20 ticks the boiler temperature decreases by 1. Every 8 ticks 2L is consumed from the current fuel and increases the temperature by 1. But when the boiler temperature is maxed, it will stop consuming fuel for further heating. This means that during the heating up of 1,000l liquid will only burn for 200 seconds, but when the boiler is at maximum temperature, the 1,000l liquid will burn for 500 seconds, equal to 300,000l steam. \n\nAs long as the boiler temperature is above 100, every 10 ticks the boiler will consume 1 liter of water and produce 300 liters of steam.

impact.83.desc=A better version of Small Coal Boiler.\n\nThe boiler has a minimum temperature of 20 and a maximum temperature of 1000. Every 40 ticks, the boiler temperature decreases by 1. Every 12 ticks 2 energy is consumed from the current fuel and increases the temperature by 1. But when the boiler temperature is maxed, it will stop consuming fuel for further heating. This means that during the heating time the coal will only burn for 48 seconds, but when the boiler is at maximum temperature the coal will burn for 160 seconds, equal to 48,000 liters of steam. \n\nAs long as the boiler temperature is above 100, every 10 ticks the boiler will consume 1 liter of water and produce 150 liters of steam. Temperatures above 100 do not increase the steam production rate. The boiler will attempt to exhaust steam through all sides of the unit except the bottom side. The boiler takes water through the bottom side, allowing the water transfer pipes to be placed under the boiler line. If the steam accumulator fills up, a quarter of its capacity will be vented and a particle of smoke and a hissing sound will be produced as a warning. Just like any GregTech machine, it will give back an empty capsule. If the boiler heated above 100 runs out of water, adding water will cause an explosion, so wait until it cools down.\n\nFuel (Energy):\n- Coal - 160 units.\n- Charcoal - 160 units.\n- Lignite - 120 units.\n- Coke Coal - 320 units.
